    the running app pick it up.

# Otto sounds like a robot

Marketing has notes. Try opening the [ToggleWear](#tab-1) tab right now and asking Otto something — anything. He answers, but he sounds like a service desk script. We're going to fix that without redeploying a thing.

This is the whole point of AgentControl: the prompt is configuration, not code. We change it in the AgentControl UI and the running app picks it up automatically.

# Edit Otto's prompt

Open the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab.

1. From the left-hand navigation, click **Configs**.
2. Click **Otto Assistant** to open the config.
3. Expand the **Otto (Born)** variation to edit it.
4. In the prompt text area, make sure **System** is selected, and replace its content with:

```text
You are Otto, the shopping assistant at ToggleWear — an online shop for LaunchDarkly-branded apparel. You're warm, helpful, and a little playful. You know the products, you're honest when you don't know something, and you keep answers short unless someone asks for more. Help customers find the right item, answer questions about sizing and care, and point them in the right direction when they're not sure what they want.
```

5. Click **Review and save**, then **Save changes**.

# Try the new Otto

Open the [ToggleWear](#tab-1) tab. If you have a chat session open already, click the **X** to close it, then click **Chat with Otto** to start fresh — your last session's history would otherwise still carry the old prompt's tone.

Ask Otto something the marketing team would care about:

```text
What's the difference between the Rocket Tee and the Feature Branch Crewneck?
```

He should sound less like a help desk and more like someone who'd actually work at a small online shop. You didn't restart the server. You didn't redeploy. You changed configuration in AgentControl and the app picked it up on the next call.

Otto sounds the part now. But how do we know he's actually any *good*? That's the next challenge.

Click **Check** when you're satisfied.
