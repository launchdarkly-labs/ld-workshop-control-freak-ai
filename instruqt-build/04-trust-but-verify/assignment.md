title: Trust But Verify
teaser: Roll out a risky new model behind a guarded rollout backed by a brand-voice
  judge — watch it auto-revert when quality drops.
notes:
- type: text
  contents: A new model came in from the vendor — Amazon Nova Pro. Marketing wants
    to try it. You want to try it too, but only if it doesn't make Otto sound off-brand.
    This is exactly what guarded rollouts are for — ship the change behind a metric,
    let it watch for regression, and automatically roll back if quality drops. The lab
    has pre-wired a brand-voice judge that scores every Otto response — that's the metric
    your rollout will watch.

# What's already in place

Most of this challenge is already wired by the lab:

- A new variation, **Otto (Stiff)**, has been added to Otto Assistant. It's backed by Amazon Nova Pro and has a deliberately corporate-sounding prompt — formal greetings, formal sign-offs, the works.
- A **brand-voice judge** has been pre-created as a separate Config and is grading every `/chat` response, emitting an `otto-brand-voice-score` metric.
- Background traffic is flowing at ~1 session every 2 seconds. Each session emits an `otto-brand-voice-score` event biased by which model served it. Stiff's mean is well below the others.

Your job is to **configure a guarded rollout** that splits traffic between Otto (Born) and Otto (Stiff), watches the `otto-brand-voice-score` metric, and rolls back automatically if Stiff's score regresses.

# Inspect what changed

1. Open the [LaunchDarkly](#tab-0) tab.
2. Go to **Configs → Otto Assistant**.
3. Notice the new variation **Otto (Stiff)** in the list. Click it to see the prompt — explicitly formal, the opposite of the brand voice.
4. Click the **Monitoring** tab and select **otto-brand-voice-score**. You should see scores accumulating — most of them in the high range (since most traffic still goes to Born), with no contribution from Stiff yet because Stiff isn't being served to anyone.

# Start the guarded rollout

1. Click the **Targeting** tab. Confirm the environment is **test**.
2. Click the **Default rule** (the fallthrough). You should see an option to **Start guarded rollout**.
3. Configure:
   - **Test variation**: **Otto (Stiff)**
   - **Control variation**: **Otto (Born)**
   - **Metric to watch**: **otto-brand-voice-score**
   - **Regression direction**: lower is worse (the metric's success criteria is HigherThanBaseline)
   - **Stages**: 10% → 25% → 50% → 100% (or whatever the UI offers). Each stage's monitoring window should be 1-2 minutes — short enough that the rollout completes inside the lab budget.
4. **On regression**: choose **Rollback** (not just notify).
5. Click **Start**.

# Watch what happens

The rollout starts at the first stage (10% Stiff). Background traffic flows through and the brand-voice score for the Stiff variation lands much lower than for Born. Within ~1-2 minutes, the rollout's regression detection should fire.

When it does:

- The rollout shows a **regression detected** event on the **Targeting** tab's rollout timeline.
- Traffic snaps back to 100% Otto (Born). The Stiff variation gets dropped.
- The monitoring view's brand-voice-score graph shows the dip during the rollout phase, then recovery after rollback.

# If you want to force it

Background traffic is intentionally low-rate so the lab fits in the time budget but doesn't burn through tokens. If the rollback doesn't fire fast enough for demo pacing, run the sabotage script from a terminal:

```bash
/opt/ld/ai-configs-intro/app/.venv/bin/python3 /opt/ld/ai-configs-intro/traffic-generator/sabotage.py
```

It emits 60 low-score events directly. The rollback usually fires within a minute of the sabotage finishing.

# What you just saw

A risky model entered production behind a metric guard. The pre-wired brand-voice judge caught the regression and rolled it back without you watching. That's the whole point: when the safety net runs itself, you can ship more aggressively.

Click **Check** when the guarded rollout is configured and running.
